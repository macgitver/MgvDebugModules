MgvDebugModules
===============

This repository contains debugging modules for MacGitver.


Enabling the debug modules
--------------------------

In order to enable them, clone https://github.com/macgitver/MacGitver.git and
its submodules. The go to the directory AddOns and clone this repository
there.

Now just recompile MacGitver.

No special actions inside MacGitver are required to access the debugging modules.

Contributing
------------

As with any Modules repository for MacGitver, please commit either only into one
module at a time or (if changes are spanning all modules) use a commit message
that makes sense for each module on its own.

Never commit organisational changes together with changes to module-code.
